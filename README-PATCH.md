# Brackets v0.4.1 â€” Examples & Docs Patch

Adds:
- `examples/basic-counter/` (session-backed counter, SPA-style form submit)
- Docs pages: `docs/simple-mode.md`, `docs/bxc-authoring.md`, `docs/examples-counter.md`
- A complete `mkdocs.yml` with the new pages wired into the nav

Apply these files into your repo root. If you already customized `mkdocs.yml`,
merge the `nav:` entries from this patch into your existing file instead of overwriting.
